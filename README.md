# Solidity-Foundry-Hub

Welcome to **SolidityForge**, a repository housing a collection of Solidity smart contracts and Foundry-based projects for Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. This repo contains experiments, decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and utility contracts, all built and tested using the Foundry toolkit.

## About
This repository serves as a hub for my Solidity and Foundry projects. Whether you're interested in smart contract development, decentralized finance (DeFi), or blockchain utilities, you'll find a variety of projects showcasing different aspects of Ethereum development. Each project includes source code, tests, and deployment scripts, leveraging Foundry's powerful tools like Forge, Cast, and Anvil.

## Prerequisites
To work with the projects in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) 
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum development
